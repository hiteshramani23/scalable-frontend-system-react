Bachelor Project: Scalable Frontend System Using React.js
- The API layer abstracts all HTTP calls.  
- The store & contexts coordinate app state and side-effects.  
- UI components are styled and follow a theme for consistency.  
- Pages aggregate components and connect to store/context.

## Key Features  
- Modular, reusable components (buttons, cards, forms)  
- Dynamic routing with React Router  
- Global state management for user authentication, settings, notifications  
- API integration demonstrating CRUD operations and real-time updates  
- Responsive design with breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
- Performance optimizations: code-splitting, lazy loading, memoization  
- Deployed with continuous integration and automatic updates  

## Outcomes & Achievements  
- Delivered a fully functional frontend system that can be extended for multiple service-based modules.  
- Achieved improved load-times and responsiveness compared to legacy frontend architecture.  
- Gained practical experience with best practices in modern web development and frontend engineering.
